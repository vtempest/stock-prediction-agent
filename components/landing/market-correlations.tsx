                Our platform combines 5-10 prediction market signals to forecast individual stock movements. The system
                requires 3 validation criteria before generating high-conviction signals: elite forecaster consensus
                (top 2% show &gt;65% agreement), cross-market confirmation (multiple related markets align), and
                traditional indicator confluence (technical analysis and fundamentals support prediction market signal).
                When all criteria meet thresholds, historical accuracy exceeds 70% over 3-6 month horizons.
