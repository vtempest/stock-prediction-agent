## Investment Risk Disclosures


IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU READ AND FULLY UNDERSTAND THE FOLLOWING RISKS OF
TRADING AND INVESTING IN YOUR SELF-DIRECTED ROBINHOOD FINANCIAL ACCOUNT.
Use of Self-Directed Trading Accounts.
All Customer Accounts are self-directed. Accordingly, unless Robinhood Financial clearly identifies
a communication as an individualized recommendation, Customers are solely responsible for any
and all orders placed in their Accounts and understand that all orders entered by them are
based on their own investment decisions or the investment decisions of their duly authorized
representative or agent. Consequently, any Customer of Robinhood Financial agrees that, unless
otherwise agreed to in writing, neither Robinhood Financial nor any of its employees, agents,
principals or representatives:
● provide investment advice in connection with a Customer Account;
● recommend any security, transaction or order;
● solicit orders;
● act as a market maker in any security;
● make discretionary trades; and
● produce or provide research. To the extent research materials or similar information is
available through Robinhood.com or the websites of any of its affiliates, these materials
are intended for informational and educational purposes only and they do not constitute a
recommendation to enter into any securities transactions or to engage in any investment
strategies.
General Risks of Trading and Investing.
All securities trading, whether in stocks, exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), options, closed-end
funds (“CEFs”) or other investment vehicles, is speculative in nature and involves substantial
risk of loss. Robinhood Financial encourages its Customers to invest carefully and to use the
information available at the websites of the SEC at http://www.sec.gov and FINRA at
http://FINRA.org. Customers can review public companies’ filings at the SEC's EDGAR page.
FINRA has published information on how to invest carefully at its website. Robinhood Financial
may also make some of this information available on its website. Robinhood Financial believes it
is very important that every Customer understands all of the risks of any form of trading or
investing prior to trading or investing real dollars. Past performance is not necessarily indicative
of future results. By investing their money in securities through Robinhood Financial, Customers
are taking full responsibility for all trading actions, and should make every effort to understand the
risks involved.

## 1. You may lose money trading and investing.

Trading and investing in securities is always risky. For that reason, Customers should trade or
invest only with money they can afford to lose. Trading stocks, ETFs and stock options
involves HIGH RISK, and YOU can LOSE a lot of money. Margin trading involves interest
charges and additional risks, including the potential to lose more than deposited or the need to
deposit additional collateral in a falling market. Before using margin, customers must
determine whether this type of trading strategy is right for them given their specific
investment objectives, experience, risk tolerance, and financial situation.

## 2. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.
All investments carry risk, and all trading decisions of an individual remain the
responsibility of that individual. There is no guarantee that systems, indicators, or trading
signals will result in profits or that they will not result in losses. All Customers are advised
to fully understand all risks associated with any kind of trading or investing they choose to
do.

## 3. Robinhood Financial is an online brokerage website and affiliated with other
nonbrokerage informational and other similar types of websites.
Neither Robinhood Financial nor its affiliates provide investment advice. Our affiliate,
Robinhood Markets, Inc., provides technology, technology support and administrative
services, and it does not offer trading or investment advice or recommend the purchase
or sale of any securities. All Robinhood Financial brokerage accounts are self-directed,
and unless Robinhood Financial clearly identifies a communication as an individualized
recommendation, all investment decisions are self-directed, the sole responsibility of the
Customer, and made at the Customer’s own risk. Therefore, Customers need to depend
on their own mastery of the details of trading and investing in order to handle
problematic situations that may arise, including the consultation of their own advisors
as they deem appropriate.

## 4. Stop orders may reduce, but not eliminate, your trading risk.
A stop market order is an order, placed with your broker, to buy or sell a particular stock at
the market price if and when the price reaches a specified level. Stop orders are often
used by traders in an effort to limit the amount they might lose. If and when the market
reaches whatever price you specify, a stop order becomes an order to execute the desired
trade at the best price immediately obtainable.
There can be no guarantee, however, that it will be possible under all market conditions to
execute the order at the price specified. In an active, volatile market, the market price may
be declining (or rising) so rapidly that there is no opportunity to liquidate your position at
the stop price you have designated. Under these circumstances, the broker's only
obligation is to execute your order at the best price that is available. Therefore, stop
orders may reduce, but not eliminate, your trading risk.
Risks of Investing in Stocks, ETFs, and CEFs.
Investments always entail some degree of risk. Be aware that:
● Some investments in stock cannot easily be sold or converted to cash. Check to see if
there is any penalty or charge if you must sell an investment quickly.
● Investments in stock issued by a company with little or no operating history or published
information involves greater risk than investing in a public company with an operating
history and extensive public information.
● Stock investments are not federally insured against a loss in market value.
● Stock you own may be subject to tender offers, mergers, reorganizations, or third-party
actions that can affect the value of your ownership interest. Pay careful attention to public
announcements and information sent to you about such transactions. They involve
complex investment decisions. Be sure you fully understand the terms of any offer to
exchange or sell your shares before you act. In some cases, such as partial or two-tier
tender offers, failure to act can have detrimental effects on your investment.
● There is a risk when buying shares of stock that the value of the stock can fall to zero. On
the other hand, the risk of selling stock short can be substantial. "Short selling" means
selling stock that the seller does not own, or any sale that is completed by the delivery of a
security borrowed by the seller. Short selling is a legitimate trading strategy, but assumes
that the seller will be able to buy the stock at a more favorable price than the price at
which they sold short. If this is not the case, then the seller will be liable for the increase in
price of the shorted stock, which could be substantial.
● Investors should consider the investment objectives and unique risk profile of an ETF
carefully before investing. ETFs are subject to risks similar to those of other diversified
portfolios. Leveraged and Inverse ETFs may not be suitable for all investors and may
increase exposure to volatility through the use of leverage, short sales of securities,
derivatives and other complex investment strategies. Although ETFs are designed to
provide investment results that generally correspond to the performance of their
respective underlying indices, they may not be able to exactly replicate the performance of
the indices because of expenses and other factors. A prospectus contains this and other
information about the ETF and should be read carefully before investing. Customers
should obtain prospectuses from issuers and/or their third party agents who distribute and
make prospectuses available for review. ETFs are required to distribute portfolio gains to
shareholders at year end. These gains may be generated by portfolio rebalancing or the
need to meet diversification requirements. ETF trading will also generate tax
consequences.
● CEFs involve unique risks. Unlike ETFs, CEFs trade on exchanges at market prices that may be
higher (“premium”) or lower (“discount”) than their net asset value (“NAV”). The market price of a
CEF is influenced by investor sentiment, supply and demand, and broader market conditions.
Persistent discounts or premiums can increase volatility and impact realized returns.
● Many CEFs employ structural or portfolio leverage, or other complex investment techniques, to
enhance income or returns. Leverage magnifies both gains and losses, which increases
exposure to volatility and may result in substantial losses. Borrowing costs and leverage
maintenance requirements can also reduce overall performance.
● Some CEFs invest in less liquid or specialized asset classes, such as municipal bonds, loans, or
alternative strategies, which may increase credit, interest rate, and liquidity risks.
● CEFs distribute income and realized capital gains, and these distributions may include a return of
capital, which can reduce the fund’s NAV. Distributions and trading activity may also create
taxable events, even when reinvested. Investors should review a CEF’s prospectus and financial
statements to understand its investment strategy, distribution policy, use of leverage, and related
tax implications before investing.
