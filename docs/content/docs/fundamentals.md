# Fundamentals vs Technicals for Trading

Fundamental indicators decide [what to trade](https://www.heygotrade.com/en/blog/technical-vs-fundamental-analysis/) (quality, value, growth, risk). Technical indicators decide [when to enter/exit](https://www.fidelity.com/bin-public/060_www_fidelity_com/documents/learning-center/Deck_Entry-and-exit-points.pdf). Traders screen for fundamentally strong stocks, then use [technicals for timing](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/07/technical-fundamental.asp).

## How fundamentals feed trading signals

[Fundamental metrics](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundamentalanalysis.asp) group into valuation, profitability, leverage, growth, and shareholder returns. Traders look for "good clusters" aligned with strategy, then use charts to time entries.

Key uses:
- **Filter universe:** Exclude weak earnings, high debt, poor returns before [technical scans](https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/five-key-financial-ratios-stock-analysis)
- **Define regime:** Expensive stocks = short/mean-reversion. Cheap, high-ROE = long/buy-dips
- **Adjust sizing:** Strong fundamentals = hold through volatility. Weak = smaller size, tighter risk

## Valuation ratios

Tell if stock is [expensive or cheap](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/101316/how-tell-if-stock-overvalued-or-undervalued.asp) vs fundamentals.

| Metric | Good buy bias | Bad/caution bias | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **P/E (trailing)** | Near/below sector average (~15–20) with solid growth. Very low (<10) can be value if not trap | Very high vs peers (>30–40) without growth. [Extreme P/E](https://app.achievable.me/study/finra-series-66/learn/economic-factors-and-business-information-valuation-ratios) (>80–100) = overvalued | Low = undervalued. [High = paying many years](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/valuation/price-earnings-ratio/) upfront |
| **Forward P/E** | Below peers while growth outlook equal/better | Far above peers with modest/declining growth | Shows if [growth is priced in](https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/10-key-financial-ratios-every-investor-should-know/) |
| **PEG (P/E ÷ growth)** | Below 1.0 = [undervalued growth](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/101316/how-tell-if-stock-overvalued-or-undervalued.asp) vs peers | Above 1.5–2.0 = paying too much | Normalizes P/E by growth rate |
| **Price-to-Sales** | Below sector norms. Many like [P/S under ~2](https://www.pocketadviser.com.au/learn/Fundamental%20Analysis/measuring-valuation) | Very high (>10) without path to profit = bubble | Useful when earnings thin/negative |
| **Price-to-Book** | Below ~2.0 = value. [Below 1.0](https://www.britannica.com/money/financial-ratios) = deep value (rare) | Very high vs sector (4–6+) = overvalued | Compares market value to net assets |

Always compare vs same industry. Good P/E for utilities ≠ good for software.

**Trading use:**
- Value longs: P/E and P/B at/below sector median, PEG < 1, technical pullback above rising 200-day MA
- Short/avoid: High P/E/PEG + slowing growth = short on breakdowns

## Profitability and quality

Show how efficiently company [converts revenue to profit](https://www.bankrate.com/investing/important-financial-ratios/).

| Metric | Good buy/hold | Bad avoid/short | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **EPS level & growth** | Consistently positive with [steady growth](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/fundamental-analysis/09/elements-stock-value.asp). Upside surprises | Negative or frequent misses. Erratic | Earnings drive long-term value |
| **Net profit margin** | Higher than industry, stable/rising | Below peers or compressing | Shows revenue → profit conversion |
| **Operating margin** | Strong and improving | Shrinking despite revenue growth | Core business strength |
| **ROE** | [>15% above peers](https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/five-key-financial-ratios-stock-analysis), sustained | Very low/volatile, below cost of equity | Measures equity capital efficiency |
| **ROA** | Above industry norm | Weak vs peers | Good for asset-heavy sectors |

**Trading use:**
- Quality longs: High rising ROE/ROA + solid margins. Buy dips on temporary news when technicals stabilize
- Low-quality shorts: Deteriorating ROE/margins + high leverage. Short when price below falling MAs

## Leverage and balance sheet

[Debt amplifies](https://www.equentis.com/blog/8-fundamental-indicators-for-stocks-in-2025/) returns and risk. Watch for crash/dilution risk.

| Metric | Good/safer | Bad/high-risk | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Debt-to-Equity** | ~0.5–1.0 in many sectors. Below sector = conservative | Very high vs peers (>2–3) = bankruptcy risk | High leverage wipes equity in downturns |
| **Interest coverage** | EBIT/EBITDA covers interest >3–5× | Coverage <1.5–2× = stress | Shows debt service ability |
| **Current/quick ratio** | Above ~1.5 = [healthy liquidity](https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0910/6-basic-financial-ratios-and-what-they-tell-you.aspx) | <1.0 = liquidity crunch risk | Short-term solvency |

**Trading use:**
Rising rates or recession fears: short high D/E, overweight low-debt names. Use technical breakdowns for timing.

## Shareholder returns

[Dividend metrics](https://groww.in/blog/financial-ratios-every-investor-should-know) influence income strategies.

| Metric | Good income buy | Bad/trap risk | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Dividend yield** | Attractive but sustainable vs sector | Extremely high (2× sector) = cut expected | Yield too high = red flag |
| **Payout ratio** | Moderate (30–60%) leaves growth room | >80–100% unsustainable | High payout caps growth |
| **Dividend growth** | Steady raises over years | Irregular cuts/freezes | Stability prized |

**Trading use:**
Buy near support before ex-div for stable growers. Avoid high-yield, stretched-payout stocks with technical weakness.

## Market cap, beta, technical overlay

- **Market cap:** Different thresholds for P/E, volatility, debt by size
- **Beta:** High-beta + strong fundamentals = aggressive longs. Weak + high-beta = short candidates
- **MAs & 52-week:** Only buy strong names above 200-day MA, not at extreme highs. Add on pullbacks with RSI/MACD confirm

## Buy/sell bias examples

**Bullish (buy on good technicals):**
- P/E and P/B at/below sector, PEG ≤ 1.2
- Positive EPS with growth, ROE > 15%
- D/E around/below 1, interest coverage > 3–5×
- Margin above sector, no liquidity flags
- Dividends: reasonable yield, 30–60% payout, stable

**Entry:** Price above rising 200-day. Pullback to support/50-day with improving RSI/MACD. Breakout with volume.

**Bearish (avoid or short on weak technicals):**
- P/E, P/S, P/B far above peers, PEG > 2, slowing/negative growth
- Deteriorating ROE and margins
- High D/E (>2–3), low coverage, tight liquidity
- Very high yield, payout near/above earnings

**Entry:** Price below falling 200-day. Failed rallies, breakdowns, negative divergences.

## Context data (CIK, officers, insiders, float)

Not direct buy/sell triggers. Used for context and edge:
- **Insiders/Form 4:** Cluster buying + good fundamentals = long bias. Persistent selling = avoid/short
- **Institutional/float:** High stable ownership in quality = supports longs. Low float + speculation = squeeze risk
